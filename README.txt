I coded this program to help a student for her homework. So feel free to use it as you wish.
Variable names and comments are in Turkish for now but I'll make an English version too.

This is a small command line program to calculate difference between two given dates in number of days.
The algorithm I implemented doesn't use any loops so it's pretty fast. Also I didn't use DateTime class for, well, educational purposes.
